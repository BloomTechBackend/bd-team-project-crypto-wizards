### Psychological safety

* **How can we take risks on this team without feeling insecure or
  embarrassed?**
* As a team we will have good communication with one another. This will allow us to step outside our comfort 
zone to learn new things. Practicing good listening skills and engaging with each other's ideas will allow us to
be open to new learning experiences. Asking questions are encouraged to confirm we have a good understanding 
of what we are trying to accomplish and work as a team.


* **How do we address situations where any team member feels unsafe?**
* We will remind each other that we are all learning together and working as a team. 
Everyone might be at a different level, but we are not competing with each other, only ourselves to improve each day. 
Working as a team gives us an advantage to learn even more from each other knowing everyone has something to contribute. 
Making sure everyone is on the same page will be a priority to have a positive experience and a successful project.

### Dependability, Structure, Clarity

* **How can we count on each other to do high quality work on time?**
* Communication will be key for a successful and quality project. Asking questions early on and laying out 
good documentation will help keep team members on track. Regular meetings discussing updates and blockers will 
leverage our productivity. Knowing what stage each team member is at when working on a task will allow others to
help out if needed and ensure the product will be delivered on time.
   
  
* **How do we address missed deadlines?**
* Missing internal deadlines are acceptable if there is good communication and discussion on what
the issue might be and how it's addressed. Working as a team is critical for success and asking for help 
is encouraged. Identifying areas that need extra time will be a key topic for initial scheduling and
daily meetings.
    

* **How can we make goals, roles, and execution plans on our team clear?**
* Establishing roles at the very beginning of the project is essential to establish 
good productivity. Identifying each team member's tasks will eliminate overlapping work 
and distribute the work proportionately. Daily meetings communicating progress or improvements 
will help identify areas of concern or confusion.


### Goals

* **Overall: What is our overall objective for the Learn & Be Curious unit?**
* Applying what weâ€™ve learned throughout BloomTech in a team project to better prepare 
ourselves for internships and full-time SDE roles. Collaborating as a team, understanding the full scope 
of a project from beginning to end, learning new skills and stepping outside our comfort zones. 
  
  
* **Performance: What do we want to prioritize in terms of what we achieve?**
* Our team will prioritize collaboration, task execution, quality work to the best of our abilities and 
push ourselves to exceed expectations.
   

* **Learning: What are the things that our team wants to learn?**
* AWS services and developer tools, API design, integration testing, scrum, 
HTML, CSS and JavaScript basics.


* **Task processes: What processes will our team follow to meet our goals,
  complete tasks, or to build team relationships?**
* Daily standup meetings, project task tracking (Trello), Discord screen sharing sessions.
