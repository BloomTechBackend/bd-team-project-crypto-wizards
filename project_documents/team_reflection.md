# Crypto Wizards Reflection

## Design

* How closely did you follow your design document after the review was complete?
  Did your implementation need to change based on what you learned once you were
  underway?

## Project

* How did you handle the ambiguity of defining your own project and user
  stories? What strategies did you use to decide on concrete work to do to
  satisfy your requirements?
* How did you deal with getting stuck on a problem? What strategies did you
  employ to get yourself unblocked?
* Did any of your commitments you made in your team charter help navigate a
  difficult decision, situation, or collaboration challenge? How?

## Scrum

* What did you find to be the most valuable part of daily stand-ups? Is there
  anything you would want to do differently at stand-up to make it more useful
  to you?
* Did you over or underestimate the work you could complete during your sprints?
  What have you learned that will help you better estimate work next time?

## Looking ahead

* If you were to start this unit over again, what would you do differently? How
  do you see yourself applying that to your work in later units, the capstone,
  or your internship?
