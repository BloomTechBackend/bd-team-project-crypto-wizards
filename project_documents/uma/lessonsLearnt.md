# Crypto Wizards Reflection

* Lessons Learnt

    * We learnt how important design doc is for a project. It gives us a visual perspective of our project.
    * Design doc also helped us to figure out how much of our vision is possible to be implemented in the given timeframe.
    * We also learnt Understanding and Planning of the project is very important.
    * We learnt how to work as a team. How important communication and trust is while working in a team.
    * We learnt that the daily stand-up meetings helped us keep each other updated on how much of the assigned work is complete and how much is pending.
    * We learnt how to integrate a project end to end.
    * We also learnt how much important research is for the project. Searching for the problem on the internet and looking at the various sample solutions gave us a new perspective for our implementation.


##Lessons learnt
*Negative*
###Event
* We realized the importance of how a well-thought-out design document impacts the project as a whole and minimizes 
issues that may develop resulting in unnecessary changes.

  *Example*
  * Realizing we didn't implement the GSI resulted in last minute feature additions to the project. Some early design 
  decisions would have changed if this was addressed in the original design documentation. 

###Recommendation
* Dedicate more time for project design documentation and planning to minimize misinterpretations or assumptions with 
project requirements. 

###Event
* We underestimated time allotted for debugging during integration testing.

  *Example*
  * There were CORS errors related to the API gateway configuration that consumed a large portion of time. Independently 
  the backend tests were successful through Postman and frontend test successful with log statements. The errors 
  occurred when connecting both frontend and backend together.

###Recommendation
* Dedicate more time for testing and structure testing differently to incorporate more integration. 

*Positive*
###Event
* Daily standup meetings allowed us to keep each other updated on progress and discuss misunderstandings or lack of 
clarity about design decisions. This resulted in great communication and trust while working as a team.

###Event
* In depth research was executed when running into issues resulting in team collaboration while eliminating 
possible causes and implementing new ideas or solutions. We learned optimal ways to research and resources to use.
