# Crypto Wizards Reflection

## Instructions

*Please answer at least one question from each section below. Answers here will
likely be inspiration for the “lessons learned” section of your project
presentation at the end of the unit.*

## Design

* How closely did you follow your design document after the review was complete?
  
  * The design doc was followed fairly close except one use case that didn't 
  get implemented and adding a different use case.

* Did your implementation need to change based on what you learned once you were
underway?

  * When planning took place, we originally wanted to add a view/chart for 
  historical data. We put this as the last use case, knowing that if we were not 
  able to implement it, we would still meet clients needs with a functional 
  site. Implementing historical data could be put into an additional phase.

## Project

* How did you handle the ambiguity of defining your own project and user
  stories? What strategies did you use to decide on concrete work to do to
  satisfy your requirements?
  
  * When defining the projects, the user stories we based on CRUD and kept 
  basic without a lot of detail. We were able to satisfy the requirements starting 
  with create and view portfolio. After those components were functioning, we moved 
  on to update which would also include removing.
  

* How did you deal with getting stuck on a problem? What strategies did you
  employ to get yourself unblocked?

  * When getting stuck on a problem, the first course of action was to research 
  using various online sources or search YouTube videos. We would then reach out 
  to other team members. If the problem still wasn't resolved, our team lead would 
  continue to troubleshoot or research while we moved on to another task. 
  By doing this, we were able to be productive with our time, and also 
  clear our head to gain focus again.


* Did any of your commitments you made in your team charter help navigate a
  difficult decision, situation, or collaboration challenge? How?

  * We communicated well as a team and reached out when help was needed. We stuck to 
  the tasks that were delighted to us and trusted each other to get each task done in 
  the appropriate amount of time. We all pushed ourselves to learn different areas to 
  understand the full scope of the project beginning to end.

## Scrum

* What did you find to be the most valuable part of daily stand-ups? Is there
  anything you would want to do differently at stand-up to make it more useful
  to you?

  * The most valuable part of the daily standup was to know where everyone was as 
  with their tasks. This gave us a good idea how to estimate our time. Our scrum 
  master was able to give direction with estimated time for each task, reminding 
  us to stay focused with functionality verses extra implementations or polishing.

* Did you over or underestimate the work you could complete during your sprints?
  What have you learned that will help you better estimate work next time?

  * Our scrum master was on track with the estimation of work for the timeline we had. 
  We were not able to implement the last use case, but that was addressed very early into 
  production knowing we could push that to an additional phase. Because we had such a great 
  team lead, I learned that consulting every idea or implementation was critical to stay on 
  schedule. Putting trust in their judgment and decisions became easy when that is often 
  a difficult thing to do.

## Looking ahead

* If you were to start this unit over again, what would you do differently? How
  do you see yourself applying that to your work in later units, the capstone,
  or your internship?

  * There is not much I would do different if we were to start this unit over. 
  We worked great as a team identifying what area each team member would be the 
  most productive with. We had a consistent work schedule and got to know each 
  other’s skill level and area of expertise quickly. It became very easy early 
  on to communicate with each other and reach out for help when needed. I realized 
  how valuable it is to work with a team, as growth in learning is multiplied by each 
  team member. I have a much better understanding how to ask questions and communicate 
  what is being done or wanting to achieve with code and will apply this in the future.
