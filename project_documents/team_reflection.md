# Crypto Wizards Reflection

## Design

* How closely did you follow your design document after the review was complete?
  Did your implementation need to change based on what you learned once you were
  underway?

We followed the design doc for the most part with the core components of the app, but 
moved some items out of scope. There were a number of things that were changed 
along the way which included moving the third party API calls to the frontend rather 
than the back. As a result, a couple classes on the backend that were associated 
were not needed. Creating a GSI was overlooked in the initial design. This was recognized 
in sprint 3, when we added the transaction history feature using GSI to fulfill the 
requirement.

## Project

* How did you handle the ambiguity of defining your own project and user
  stories? What strategies did you use to decide on concrete work to do to
  satisfy your requirements?

Working off the given documents and previous projects helped define our project 
and user stories. Team discussions to clarify the understanding of the project and 
reviews established what was needed to satisfy the requirements. 

* How did you deal with getting stuck on a problem? What strategies did you
  employ to get yourself unblocked?

When problems occurred implementing features, the first course of action was research 
using various online sources or video/tutorials. The next step was reaching out 
to team members for input on a solution or an alternative approach. When bugs were 
found, process of elimination would narrow down the possible cause or a specific search 
terms was used to find similar issues others have dealt with.

* Did any of your commitments you made in your team charter help navigate a
  difficult decision, situation, or collaboration challenge? How?

Communication and reaching out to other team members helped navigate through 
difficult situations. Tasks were divided to work on different sections of the project,
and we all pushed ourselves to learn different areas to understand the full scope 
of the project beginning to end.

## Scrum

* What did you find to be the most valuable part of daily stand-ups? Is there
  anything you would want to do differently at stand-up to make it more useful
  to you?

Daily meetings were a good way to resolve any misunderstandings or lack of clarity 
on design decisions.They also helped with reviewing what was accomplished and 
discuss goals for the rest of the day.

* Did you over or underestimate the work you could complete during your sprints?
  What have you learned that will help you better estimate work next time?

The time estimated was fairly on track, however, time to implement the backend 
was a little overestimated and implementation for the frontend was underestimated. 
More time dedicated to integration testing would have benefited us as we found 
testing the front and backend independently was successful, but errors occurred 
when connecting both together.

## Looking ahead

* If you were to start this unit over again, what would you do differently? How
  do you see yourself applying that to your work in later units, the capstone,
  or your internship?

Dedicating more time for project design and planning could have been done differently 
as well as allowing more time to learn frontend using React. Overall, we worked great 
together as a team identifying what area each team member would be the most productive 
with and got to know each otherâ€™s skill level and area of expertise quickly. 

Applying what we learned will help save time on future projects in later units and on 
the job especially with larger projects. Working on implementing a project end to end 
has given a lot of perspective that will be used in the future.
