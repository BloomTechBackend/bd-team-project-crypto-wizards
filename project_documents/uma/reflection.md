# Crypto Wizards Reflection

## Instructions

*Please answer at least one question from each section below. Answers here will
likely be inspiration for the “lessons learned” section of your project
presentation at the end of the unit.*

## Design

* How closely did you follow your design document after the review was complete?
Did your implementation need to change based on what you learned once you were
underway? 

  * We started off by building the project based on the design doc but a lot of small implementation changes were made based on the challenges we faced while building the project.

## Project

* How did you handle the ambiguity of defining your own project and user
  stories? What strategies did you use to decide on concrete work to do to
  satisfy your requirements?

  * We looked at the given sample document and worked off of that. We discussed to clarify our understandings and then reviewed once it was complete.
  
* How did you deal with getting stuck on a problem? What strategies did you
  employ to get yourself unblocked?

  * When we got stuck on a problem,
    - we searched on Google for various solutions
    - Discussed with our teammates.
    - searched for alternative approaches if needed
    - reviewed the implementation with each other. 

* Did any of your commitments you made in your team charter help navigate a
  difficult decision, situation, or collaboration challenge? How?
  * We always trusted each other to complete their share of the work.
  * We communicated with each other clearly whenever there were some clarifications required.
  * We had our work divided in such a way that each of us could work on one section of the project.

## Scrum

* What did you find to be the most valuable part of daily stand-ups? Is there
  anything you would want to do differently at stand-up to make it more useful
  to you?
  
  * In the daily stand-ups, we were able to clarify our doubts with each other, discuss implementations and alternative approaches.
  
* Did you over or underestimate the work you could complete during your sprints?
  What have you learned that will help you better estimate work next time?
    
  * We almost had an idea of how much work was need to implement our vision. Whatever little we overestimated, we modified our project to implement only the functionalities that were feasible in the given timeframe. 

## Looking ahead

* If you were to start this unit over again, what would you do differently? How
  do you see yourself applying that to your work in later units, the capstone,
  or your internship?

  * If given an opportunity to start the unit over again, I would learn more about the front-end the next time around. I think learning how to implement a project end to end has given a lot of perspective on how an actual team in a company would work.
